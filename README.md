## abbotsbury

Minimalistic command-line citation manager. A Haskell port of https://github.com/yongrenjie/cygnet.

It is eventually intended that this will be the main version, after all the current features in `cygnet` are implemented.
To see a list of features that have been / need to be implemented, see https://github.com/yongrenjie/abbotsbury/issues/1.

The name is taken from the [Abbotsbury Swannery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbotsbury_Swannery) in Dorset, UK, which I had the luck to visit in 2018:
