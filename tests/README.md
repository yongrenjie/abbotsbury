## Test JSON data used for abbotsbury

The files in this directory have been downloaded directly from Crossref: this has obvious benefits in that we don't need to redownload the file each time tests are run (which avoids spamming Crossref servers, and also makes tests faster).

The papers / DOIs I've used for this are as follows:
